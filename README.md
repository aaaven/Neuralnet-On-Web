# Neuralnet On Web
❤️AI-Art Series Classes：Neural Networks On Web ❤️AI艺术系列课程：神经互联网络

## Class Information
* Instructor: [Aven Le Zhou 周乐](https://www.aven.cc)
* Creative Coding Framework(s): [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and (perhaps) [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)
* Class Website: [OF Course](https://ofcourse.io)
* Learning Hours: 8 Classes * ( approx. 1 ~ 1.5 hours video lecture + approx. 3 hours practice)

## Class Goals
The goal of this class is to learn and understand basic machine learning concepts, and focus on application of machine learning techniques and to create artistic and creative interaction in browser. Libraries like [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) will be covered. In the class, we will run models in the browser using high-level APIs from ml5.js, as well as TensorFlow.js to custom software/website to achieve creative goals. At the completion of this course, students will have a good understanding of a few machine learning models, how do they work, (maybe)how to train these models, and their use case to creative projects.

## Special Thanks
This class is based on and inspired by serveral classes:
    * [Interactive Machine Learning](https://github.com/imachines/IMA-Interactive-Machine-Learning) at IMA, NYU Shanghai
    * [Machine Learning for the Web](https://github.com/yining1023/machine-learning-for-the-web) at ITP, NYU

And most of the class examples are adapted from previous classes and [ml5.js official examples](https://ml5js.org/docs/quick-start).
