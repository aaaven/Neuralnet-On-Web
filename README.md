## Class Information
* Instructor: [Aven Le Zhou Âë®‰πê](https://www.aven.cc)
* Creative Coding Framework(s): [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and (perhaps) [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)
* Class Website: [OF Course](https://ofcourse.io)
* Learning Hours: 8 Classes * ( approx. 1 ~ 1.5 hours video lecture + approx. 3 hours practice)

## Class Goals
The goal of this class is to learn and understand basic machine learning concepts, and focus on the applications of machine learning techniques (mostly machine vision related) and to create artistic or fun interaction in the browser. Libraries like [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) will be used and machine vision related models/algorithms like Mobilenet, Posenet, KNN will be explained in details. In the class, we will run models in the browser using high-level APIs from ml5.js, as well as TensorFlow.js to custom software/website to achieve creative goals. At the completion of this course, students will have a good understanding of a few machine learning models, how do they work, (maybe)how to train these models, and their use case to creative projects.

## Special Thanks
* This class is based on and inspired by several classes:
